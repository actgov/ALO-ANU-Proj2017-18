 Looked at the possibility of using either Gitlab or Trello for documentation
 Understanding the syntax of the gitlab wiki - https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/markdown.html



18/08


 Decided to go with Gitlab for documentation purposes
 Ran through three different data collection options with the clients: Google Forms, Canvas and SmartSurvey. Decided they would use all three to determine which is the best


20/08


 Instructions on how to use the different options sent to the ALO's to be used in the upcoming week and a half before we go out in the field with them


21/08 --  Tutorial 


 Shayne suggested that the trial use of our different solutions may be ineffective due to the lack of team supervision caused by the ALO's inability to meet this week
 Suggested that we take a more systems approach to the project, as opposed to the analytical process we appeared to have currently


24/08 -- Team meeting


 Discussed the scope of the project - should the scope encompass secondary features or just the central function of data collection and analytics
 Discussed whether our program/webpage should output data that can be used by a secondary software for analytics, or whether our program itself should do the analytics
 Decided that we would need to get legal advice regarding servers - can the server be off-the-shelf or does it need to be secure and locally hosted due to the sensitivity of the information?
 How will the authenticity of the reports be verified, to avoid anyone from inputting data. Discussion about whether this is within the team's scope (an ACT govt. issue rather than ours) - Could the ALO then misrepresent data?


31/8/17 - Week 6 Meeting


Have the ACT health privacy policy from Connie, that whatever platform we go with must meet.
Prepare current progress and ideas for Ole to pitch to Head of Digital Tech Gov, to get answers to questions we need in order to progress project. 
Report generating interface requirements. Only Sarah and Connie to see combined data of the ALO's


5/9/17 -- Lawyer meeting


Next steps; To attain the softwares privacy policy (they should have a standard one they send out to potential clients) so we can go through it with them, check it matches clients requirements. 
She suggested we ask around similar services ie social services etc and see what they use. 
ANUSA legal team use LEAP. 


7/9/17 - Sarah and Connie Report Requirements


Search by Date range
Search by different variables including known versus unknown consumer, age group, gender, location, staff member etc.  Essentially a configuration of any or all of the fields
Single button to produce an automatic report on a monthly basis which includes occasions of service, length of service, by team and by individual ALO etc
Bar or line graphs for above to visually represent the data trends


8/9/17 - Results from CIO Meeting (Week 6)


The data collected from the app will be considered “activity tracking” which will mean that there is a great flexibility with storage of the data as security is not considered an issue so we don’t have to adhere to legislation and privacy principles.
The CIO will support us to integrate the data collection into the ACT Gov ‘data lake’.
To support the above, the CIO will ask the Solutions Architect to come to one of our meetings (hopefully 21st Sep) to discuss the ACT Gov requirements, how to integrate, etc. This should answer many of your questions.
Following the completion of the project, as ACT Health will need to take over maintenance, we will require a ‘technical documentation’ at handover date. I believe this is a component of your project in any case? This is exciting because that means your project has a realistic chance to become part of government use well beyond the length of the project (looks good for the CV)!
